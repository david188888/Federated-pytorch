# Federated-pytorch


- Introduction
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   I used the Flower framework to implement the process of<p>
   aggregating their parameters on different clients to realize federated learning.

- How to start
  ---
1. Download the dataset correctly
2. Run the server
   ```python
   python server.py
   ```
   ---
3. Run the client
   ```python
   python client.py
    ```

This project was inspired by and guided in part by the following video resource:

- [Federated Learning Quickstart with Flower and PyTorch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOmmuzMIQ4c&ab_channel=Flower)

I have adopted some of the ideas and technical implementations presented in this video. Special thanks to Flower for sharing valuable insights and knowledge that contributed significantly to the development of this project
